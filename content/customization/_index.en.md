A lot of people want to add a personal touch on top of their pwnagotchi. Thats why we decided on adding this page to the wiki.

If you want to **change the layout** of different things, or **change the faces** entirely, this is the place to look for guides.

Please ensure you **perform a backup** before installing any visual modifications. Additionally, please note that if changes and updates do not appear (even after a reboot), you may need to **unload and reload the plugin** to ensure proper display.

First of all, you will need a **Raspberry Pi 0 W**. You can get those for around 10-15$ at your local electronics store or pi dealer. You can use [this website](https://rpilocator.com/) to find availability near you.

Next, a microSD card, you'd be best with 16GB or more. Those go for around 8-10$ on Amazon; I highly recommend you pay extra for premium quality brands like Samsung, Kingston or SanDisk. Also, note that microSD cards have different speed ratings, look for UHS-I class and higher. You can read more about those [in this blogpost by Kingston](https://www.kingston.com/en/blog/personal-storage/memory-card-speed-classes). You will also need a microSD card reader, what form depends on you, I recommend those small USB readers.

A good quality micro USB cable that can do data transfer. Be aware that some cables (especially cheap ones) are wired for _power only_, meaning you won't be able to connect to your pi during the initial setup. I highly recommend you get a higher quality cable, both from a durability and reliability standpoint, and from the "being able to transfer data" standpoint. You can get them from Amazon for around 5-10$ depending on the brand, I can recommend Amazon Basics, Vention and Ugreen.

Lastly, you'd want to get yourself a power bank, or a battery bank. It doesn't really matter which one, you only need standard USB output that can deliver about 1-1.5A, which most power banks can do. Obviously, the higher the capacity, measured in mAh, the longer you can pwn. Neat features may come with the power bank such as being able to charge the power bank while using it, which is good for car setups, but the features you want depends on you. I can recommend brands like Ugreen, Baseus, Xiaomi, Anker and Viking for power banks.

Optionally, if you dont have a case, get yourself a rubber band or two, so you can put together the pi on your powerbank.

Total cost amounts to around 40$ for decent quality accessories. You can go lower with the price (especially if you re-use things you have like cables and power banks), but I won't recommend cheaping out too much.

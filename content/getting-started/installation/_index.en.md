There isn't much to this, once you have downloaded your `.img` file from Github, plug in your SD card reader with microSD card in it, and run [Raspberry] Imager. You will see windows similar to this:

In there, choose the OS by clicking the button, scrolling to bottom and selecting "Use custom". Use the popup navigator to locate your `.img` file on your computer. After that, select your storage. If you have only one USB flash drive plugged in, it should be the only option, like this (the text might say something different but you get the gist):

Select that option!

And also choose no at this point:

## Flashing
That is everything, you can hit "Save" on the bottom, and hit "Write" on the main screen. This process can take up to few minutes, depending on your SD card, reader and drive from which you are reading the image from. Be patient. When the flashing is done, you will get a message that it is done.
